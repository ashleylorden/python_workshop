Python Workshop

We will have several sessions of a workshop to learn basic Python.
We'll use Python2 in Lyft's typical code style; there are small tweaks for Python3 code that we won't cover.
In the first one, we'll practice parsing a CSV and get used to various Python principals.
Follow along by checking out the parse_csv files. Each one expands a new skill.

Parse CSV 1: Basic Python code organization, read in CSV data

Parse CSV 2: Tracking data in a loop; usage of Try/Except, Regex, string formatting

Parse CSV 3: Process data in a list; how to choose between ways to do something using timeit

Parse CSV 4: Object Oriented Programming

Look for "Use APIs" topic for the next session!
